AR App crashing on my Phone when ARsession is loaded. (Unity 2019.)



I have made a Unity Project with 2 scenes:
1. The main menu screen:

2. The Ar session Scene

When I hit play the App crashes. I have tried the following:

1. Changed the ARFoundation and ARCore Version from Package Manager.
2. Tried a basic and plain new Unity Project in both Unity 2020 and 2019.4.
3. Rebooting My Phone
4. Trying APK on other Android devices of my Family and Friends (It works on their device just fine)

One thing I have noticed is that any project without AR-Session in the hierarchy runs just fine (Which explains why the App doest Crash in the Main Menu Screen)

But as soon as it tried to load an ARSession, it crashes.

I managed to get the crash report which is attached below:

Can someone suggest any device settings for android to fix this? Because I have also found that usual solution is to Factory reset the device. Which I am avoiding, as its my personal phone and not a test phone.

Phone: POCO f1, Andoird 10
Unity: 2019.4
ARFoundation: 4.1.0 (or any other version results the same outcome)
ARCore: 4.1.0 (or any other version results the same outcome)

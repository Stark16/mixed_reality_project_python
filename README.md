# Mixed Reality Project (PAUSED)
# üìå About
This project was inspired by the idea of delivering a **Vision Pro-like** experience on Android using **Google Cardboard** and clever engineering‚Äîyears before the Vision Pro was launched.

Initially, I was experimenting with Augmented Reality in another project, COD_Realism, which led to the development of this concept.

# üéØ Planned Features
The goal of this app is to help visual thinkers brainstorm ideas by transforming their thoughts into virtual screens and sticky notes within a Mixed Reality (MR) environment.

# ‚ú® Core Functionalities
### **Mind-Space**
Users can place virtual sticky notes and YouTube links inside physical spaces (e.g., dorm rooms, conference rooms) using hand gestures. These objects stay anchored in the real world.

### **Voice Dictation**
Users can take notes using speech-to-text for faster input compared to typing.

### **Collaborative Environment**
Multiple users can join the same MR workspace using headsets, allowing real-time collaboration (inspired by NVIDIA‚Äôs Holodeck VR).
